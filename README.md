<h1>Electron Pomodoro Timer</h1>

A fun little project to build something using Electron and TypeScript.

</div>

## App Vision

I was inspired by another pomodoro timer and wanted to get some practice and learn by building one myself.

I want the timer to have the core pomodoro timer functionality, have a tasks functionality, maybe a theme editor, and anything else I dream up!

<div style="margin-bottom: 2em"></div>

## Goals

- Learn about Electron
- Learn about TypeScript
- Practice forethought of app design
- Make things as reuseable as possible while not over-engineering
- Make a sweet Pomodoro Timer that _I can use_!
- _Maybe_ attempt to package or version the app to do that for the first time and learn
